# Purification-based bounds for multiparameter quantum channel estimation

This repository provides MATLAB code to evaluate the bounds derived in the paper [F. Albarelli and R. Demkowicz-Dobrza≈Ñski, "Probe incompatibility in multiparameter noisy quantum channel estimation" arXiv:2104:XXXX](https://arxiv.org/)

In the paper the general scenario of bounding the sum of the single-parameter QFI of different channels is considered (i.e. the random sensing scenario described in the paper).
However, the code provided only works in the multiparameter channel estimation setting, where there is only one channel and the figure of merit is the trace of the QFI matrix.

<!-- ## Structure of repository

* `Data` contains the raw data produced by the simulation.
* `Matlab` contains Matlab code which is used for solving the SDP.
* `Plots` contains the plots generated by the simulation. -->

### Usage

We provide two main functions:
```
	[] = totalQFI_SDP()
```
evaluates the optimal total QFI, either for a single use of the channel `version=single` or the asymptotic standard quantum limit bound `version=asymptotic`.

```
	[] = optistate_SDP()
```
gives an optimal state attaining the optimal total QFI and the corresponding QFI matrix.

Some possibly nontrivial conventions are that the Kraus operators `K1,K2,...` are stacked in column as `KrausOps=[ K1 ; K2 ; K3; ... ]` and their partial derivatives, stacked in column, one parameter after the other as `KrausOpsDeriv=[ d1K1 ; d1K2 ; K3; ... d2K1 ; d2K2; d2K3 ...   ]`.
The purification matrices are returned in a single tensor of dimension `[ nKraus, nKraus, npar ]` and are individually accessed as `hvec(:,:,i)`. 
The other input arguments should be intuitive, the program does not check for consistency among the provided dimensions, so make sure to provide consistent input data.
A detailed description of the input and output arguments can be obtained by typing `help totalQFI_SDP` and `help optistate_SDP` in the MATLAB Command Window.

### Requirements

* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). 
* [QETLAB](https://github.com/nathanieljohnston/QETLAB).
* [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) with an SDP solver: [SDPT3](https://github.com/SQLP/SDPT3) and [SCS](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs) are free, while [MOSEK](http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/mosek.html) is commercial, but free for academic use.
